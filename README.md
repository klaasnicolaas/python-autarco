Asynchronous Python client for the Autarco Inverters (External API).

## About

A python package with which you can read the data of your [Autarco][autarco]
Inverter(s). This is done by making a request to the [My Autarco][my-autarco]
platform, for this you will need the `email` and `password`.
The data on the platform is updated every 5 minutes.

### Public key

You can find this in the url after logging in,
example: `https://my.autarco.com/site/{public_key}`

Or by using the `get_account` function, and use the `public_key` attribute.

## Installation

```bash
pip install autarco
```

## Usage

```python
import asyncio

from autarco import Autarco


async def main():
    """Show example on getting Autarco data."""
    async with Autarco(
        email="test@autarco.com",
        password="password",
    ) as client:
        account_sites = await client.get_account()

        inverters = await client.get_inverters(account_sites[0].public_key)
        battery = await client.get_battery(account_sites[0].public_key)
        solar = await client.get_solar(account_sites[0].public_key)
        site = await client.get_site(account_sites[0].public_key)
        print(inverters)
        print(battery)
        print(solar)
        print(site)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](./examples/).

## Datasets

You can read the following with this package:

- **Account** data with all the sites you have access to.
- **Inverter(s)** data with the power output, energy output, grid status and health status.
- **Solar** data with the power production, energy production of today, this month and total.
- **Battery** data with insights into your batteries.
- **Site** general information about a specific site.
- **Statistics** of the inverter(s) with power and energy data.

### Statistics

It is possible to retrieve inverter(s) statistical data from the API, a distinction has been made into two types:

#### Power

Parameters to get the **power** statistics of the site.

- **query_range** (default: `day`) - The range of the query, can be `day` or `week`.

| Name                | Type   | Description                             |
| :------------------ | :----- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `graphs`.`pv_power` | `dict` | The power statistics for each inverter. |

You can generate a better list with the property `generate_power_stats_inverter` of the `Stats` object.

#### Energy

Parameters to get the **energy** statistics of the site.

- **query_range** (default: `month`) - The range of the query, can be `month`, `year` or `total`.

| Name                 | Type   | Description                              |
| :------------------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `graphs`.`pv_energy` | `dict` | The energy statistics for each inverter. |

You can generate a better list with the property `generate_energy_stats_inverter` of the `Stats` object.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

The simplest way to begin is by utilizing the [Dev Container][devcontainer]
feature of Visual Studio Code or by opening a CodeSpace directly on GitHub.
By clicking the button below you immediately start a Dev Container in Visual Studio Code.

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This Python project relies on [Poetry][poetry] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages, to enter or exit the venv run the following commands:

```bash
poetry shell
exit
```

Setup the pre-commit check, you must run this inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

*Now you're all set to get started!*

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

To update the [syrupy](https://github.com/tophat/syrupy) snapshot tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest --snapshot-update
```
